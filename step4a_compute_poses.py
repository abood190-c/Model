STEP 4A: COMPUTE CANONICAL POSES (FIXED)
==========================================
Previous version averaged across both original AND mirrored samples,
which caused X coordinates to cancel out to zero (symmetric around origin).

Fix: We take only the first half of each class — the original samples
recorded before mirror augmentation was applied. Since mirror_augmentation.py
concatenated [original, mirrored] and then shuffled, we can't easily
separate them by position anymore.

Better approach: re-extract canonical poses directly from the dataset
images for one consistent hand orientation, OR use the pre-augmentation
CSV if you saved it.

Simplest reliable fix: re-run landmark extraction on a small sample
per class (50 images) at the original orientation, compute means from
those. This is fast (~1 min) and guaranteed to give one-handed poses.

Usage:
